An array is defined as a collection of items that are stored at contiguous memory locations. It is a container which can hold a fixed number of items, and these items should be of the same type. An array is popular in most programming languages like C/C++, JavaScript, Python, etc.

Array is an idea of storing multiple items of the same type together and it makes easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to the base value. A combination of the arrays could save a lot of time by reducing the overall size of the code. It is used to store multiple values in single variable
